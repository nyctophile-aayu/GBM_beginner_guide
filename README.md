Database, reduce, and analyze GBM data without having to know anything. Curiosity killed the catalog.

## What is this?

* Creates a MongoDB database of GRBs observed by GBM. 
* Heuristic algorithms are applied to search for the background regions in the time series of GBM light curves. 
* Analysis notebooks can be generated on the fly for both time-integrated and time-resolved spectral fitting. 

 <p style="color: red;"> Of course, this analysis is highly opinionated.</p>

## What this is not

Animal cruelty. 

## What can you do?

Assuming you have built a local database (tis possible, see below), just type:

```bash
$> get_grb_analysis --grb GRBYYMMDDxxx

```

magic happens, and then you can look at your locally built GRB analysis notebook. 

If you want to do more, go ahead and fit the spectra:

```bash
$> get_grb_analysis --grb GRBYYMMDDxxx --run-fit

```

And your automatic (but mutable) analysis is ready:

## Building the database

The concept behind this is to query the Fermi GBM database for basic trigger info, use this in combination tools such as [gbmgeometry](https://gbmgeometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to figure out which detectors produce the best data for each GRB, and then figure out preliminary selections / parameters / setups for subsequent analysis. 


```bash
$> build_catalog --n_grbs 100 --port 8989

```


This process starts with launching [luigi](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which mangages the pipline:

All the of the metadata about the process is stored in a [mondoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database which can be referenced later when building analyses.
